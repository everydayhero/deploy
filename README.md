#  Deploy

Deploying should be easy, 1,000 configuration options having to be set
for each application sucks. This gem sets the defaults that Everyday
Hero use on a per application basis and allows an application to
override as required.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'deploy'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install deploy
